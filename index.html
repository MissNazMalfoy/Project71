      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who acceses the canteen could be provided witha School Canteen Account on thr school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> 1. Accuracy
     Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimalize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate perfomance and payroll data. <br>
    2. Economics 
     Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absentism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Aesium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management system. <br>
    3. Productivity / Efficiency
     Monitoring and managing atttendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborius, and expensive affair. It takes time to proccess paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious adminstration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits. And many more like Visibility / Insights, hassle free Workflow Management,
     Flexibility, Integration / Configuration, Real-time Tracking, Security, and Compliance
